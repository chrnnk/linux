Use virtIO for disk and network for best performance. Linux has built in drivers, Windows need virtIO ISO

DO NOT use memory ballooning on Windows VMs (The Balloon driver has been a source of performance problems on Windows, you should avoid it. (see http://forum.proxmox.com/threads/20265-SOLVED-Hyper-Threading-vs-No-Hyper-Threading-Fixed-vs-Variable-Memory for the discussion thread) )

Mode        	Host Page Cache 	  Disk Write Cache 	Notes
none        	disabled 	enabled 	balances performance and safety (better writes)
writethrough 	enabled 	disabled 	balances performance and safety (better reads)
writeback   	enabled 	enabled 	fast, can loose data on power outage depending on hardware used
directsync   	disabled 	disabled 	safest but slowest (relative to the others)
unsafe       	enabled 	enabled 	doesn't flush data, fastest and unsafest 

cache=none seems to be the best performance and is the default since Proxmox 2.X.
